README.txt

To build the C++ parts:

1. change to the "main" directory under jni and run "ndk-build"
2. run soClr (or linux equivalent) to remove duplicate shared libs
   that will confuse gradle.

This part of the build instructions may (and should) change as
gradle and/or the gradle plugin upgrades.
